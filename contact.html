            <p id="about">&emsp;Hey there! I’m Kindra.<br> 
                &emsp;Everyone from my high school would have told you I would have been an art major, so it must have been a surprise to them when I first declared in computer science. My first experience with UI/UX was from a CS class: the assignment was to create a spreadsheet and I spent more time on the UI than a typical back-end developer would. That was my first sign, but back then I had no idea the field of UI/UX existed. I continued with CS until eventually switching to a BS in Games where I took my first official UI class. It was extremely surface-level, but I fell in love with the subject and started looking for any other classes I could take on the topic but couldn’t find any, so I turned to the internet to teach myself what wasn't available to me at my university. Finding resources for UI in games online can be fairly difficult, and while there are a good number of people explaining implementation, theory is much harder to come by. This pushed me to learn as much as I could about non-game UI/UX design.<br>
                &emsp;I was able to find experience in UI/UX along the way, working on my class projects, game jams, even at professionally as an IT technician at a non-profit where I was able to redesign the UI/UX of a critical internal application that was praised by many of my coworkers and still in use today. <br>
                &emsp;A semester before I was due to graduate, I was directed to an advertisement about a UX/UI boot camp being offered by my university-- it was as if the stars were aligning-- so I signed up and spent my last semester juggling my capstone class, my job, and my boot camp. My focus had initially been on games UI/UX, but as I continued my studies, I found that I really enjoyed whatever UIs I could get my hands on.<br>
                &emsp;I really enjoy the entire UI/UX pipeline, with particular interest in UX and I have found a certain joy in front-end development. I am excited to learn more and improve my skills; I think my background in both art and computer science has lended me a strong overview of everything surrounding UI/UX. I am now looking to develop both my knowledge and practical experience in the UI/UX world!
