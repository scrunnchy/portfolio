                <p><i>Nyaa-kuza!!</i> is a narrative based fighting game where you play as an ex-yakuza cat,
                    traveling through the outskirts of Japan in order to save your catnapped wife!<br>
                    Nyaa was my capstone project, it went through many iterations and rebrands before 
                    we <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1577450/Nyaakuza/">published on Steam</a>.
                     My own role changed multiple times throughout the development 
                    cycle as it became apparent that the team was in need of strong leadership. I made the
                    decision to put my team first and focus on being a producer-- a role I had on previous games--
                    rather than focusing soley on UX design, and I think it paid off 
                    tremendously. I didn't get to spend as much time iterating on and testing the UX as 
                    I would in a perfect world, but my team was grateful to have me at the helm
                    as we consistently impressed our professors and classmates with our progress between sprints.
                    When development began I was largely self-taught in UI/UX design, though during the last 3 months
                    of development I began attending a UX/UI boot camp.

            <h3 class="header">Ideation</h3>
            <p class="text">
                &emsp; We had lofty goals for Nyaa in the beginning.
                We envisioned a narratively-driven RPG with brawler elements, and
                the artists quickly created concept sketches that cemented the
                style and setting. Using those sketches and the discussions we 
                were having as a team, I created a moodboard for the UI. I wanted 
                to evoke the feeling of a Japanese city like Tokyo with the use of 
                neon, paper lanterns, and textures from traditional kimonos and 
                tattoos. Since our game was sure to have fighting and dialogue, 
                I took UX inspiration from fighting games and role-playing games 
                like the Naruto fighting games and <i>Persona 5</i>.
                The writers made many requests about how the dialogue UX/UI should
                look and function, and I endeavored to synthesize conflicting 
                requests into a design that would satisfy everyone, but most 
                importantly be intuitive to the player. 
                <br>
                &emsp; As development continued, I began designing the fighting HUD. I
                originally envisioned the health bar as a large paw where each toe 
                would act as a marker of health, then once I began considering a
                rage meter I updated my design to have the paw act as a single object.
                The rage meter was inspired by Doom Guy’s face in the original Doom;
                I wanted to show an increase in rage as well as change facial 
                expressions. The inventory UI elements would change color as
                the weapons were used and entered a cooldown.

            <h3 class="header">Choosing an Engine</h3>
            <p class="text">
                &emsp; Originally, we had chosen Unity 3D to develop the game. We were able to build
                out a basic exploration level and combat level. We had decided to use an 
                isometric view in the exploration level and a side-view in combat (inspired 
                by fighting games). Much of the basic layout of the UX/UI was mapped out at 
                this stage.
                <br>
                &emsp; It quickly became evident that Unity 3D would fight us most of the way, 
                the physics of the isometric level was extremely floaty and difficult to 
                wrangle, and level building took a long time as few on the team had prior 
                experience with 3D level building. Switchibg was risky, but would save us a 
                headache in the long run, so we scrapped the 3D version of the game and 
                rebuilt it entirely in Unity 2D. The physics reacted better, though 
                there were still problems, and level building was much faster.</p>

                &emsp; I laid the groundwork for the main menu during the 2D rebuild and 
                the UI artist provided the first official UI assets for me to plug into the UI.
                At this time the team did not have an idea of what the background art for the main menus 
                would look like, and so the layouts I designed were mostly placeholders.</p>

                &emsp; The artist who illustrated our menu and dialogue backgrounds
                explained to me that he had a vision of the main menu: he would provide an 
                illustration that the camera would slide down, finally coming to rest and the 
                UI elements would fade in. He provided me with a rough illustration and 
                the UI artists created our logo. I used these to design the final 
                layout and build out the other menus. </p>

            <p class="text">
                &emsp; I rapidly iterated on the dialogue UX with the input of the writers. They 
                referenced UI’s from games like <i>Persona 5</i> and <i>Stardew Valley</i>, combining these 
                two disparate UX layouts proved to be a bit difficult, so I created a 
                number of mock-ups in the engine to show potential layouts given the 
                inspiration. I also gave my opinion on which design would be most intuitive for 
                the player. We finally agreed on a layout and I added the dialogue assets that 
                the UI artist had finished.</p>

            <p class="text">
                &emsp; It became evident that, similar to Unity 3d, the isometric view 
                was eating up a lot of time. The physics were still strange, and our artists 
                had to produce twice as many assets. In the interest of protecting our time
                and creating a game we could be proud of, we decided to cut out the isometric view,
                switching the exploration levels to a side-view. 
                <br>This is also when the engineers implemented the fighting HUD. Some of our 
                planned mechanics had been dropped or changed, and after seeing how it was 
                implemented I began brainstorming different designs.

            <p class="text">
                &emsp; During my engineering-inspired brainstorming, I looked at 
                many brawler-type games for inspiration, including <i>Brawlhala</i> and 
                <i>Speed Brawl</i>. I sent a few rough sketches of the health/rage widget to 
                the UI artist to get his input on what design he liked most. I 
                also realized my original conception of the ‘inventory orbs’, as I had 
                begun calling them, took too much space on the screen and had the 
                potential to obfuscate the items displayed in the element, as well as 
                simply not matching the assets from the UI artist. I took a 
                screenshot into Photoshop and made a mockup of new inventory UI assets 
                that I felt better fit the style and would not obscure the screen or 
                objects inside them. I passed this design along to the UI artist and we 
                discussed some alternate designs, including an accessibility feature 
                to show the keyboard command for the weapon on the corresponding 
                element.</p>

                a simple all-pink, except for the ‘skip’ button which had been added by 
                the engineers to make debugging easier, and had the added benefit of

                had previously existed only with programmer art, and set the buttons 
                for travel above the corresponding areas, as well as added a sakura petal particle

            <h3 class="header">Controls Iterations</h3>
            <p class="text">
                &emsp; We had gone back-and-forth on controls throughout all of 
                development, and I still think they probably aren’t perfect. We were 
                running out of development time, we had wanted to add re-mappable 
                controls, but it was proving difficult to add in before our publishing 
                date as we had lost three of our five engineers throughout development 
                and there were still a lot of other engineering concerns to address. I 
                suggested we instead add three types of control schemes for 
                accessibility to make up for the lack of remapping, so we set to work 
                on keyboard-only, keyboard and mouse (a much requested feature), and 
                controller-only schemes. </p>

            <h3 class="header">Dialogue Iterations</h3>
            <p class="text">
                &emsp; At this time, we received feedback that the UX of the 
                dialogue was confusing to players. Due to F-shaped pattern reading, 
                players would read the reaction before the main text. I 
                also realized that the UI buttons were not all using the same color 
                palette and wanted to set these to the same palette for consistency 
                across the game. I set out redesigning the UX of the dialogue and I 
                also added an animated arrow to indicate to the player that the main 
                dialogue is a now button, as previously the writers had been using an 
                extra dialogue button with ellipses to load the remainder of 
                truncated text. I decided on a blue color scheme with yellow as a 
                compliment since much of the game was pink and the yellow would 
                stand out nicely against our game’s palette. At this stage we  
                added in sprite animations to the dialogue UI which helped immensely 
                with readability. I also added in the sakura particle effect and a 
                dust particle effect to the background of the 
                dialogue scenes to add some interest to an otherwise static scene.</p>

                &emsp; The initial rage meter used the same palette that our 
                other assets used, including our environmental assets, meaning the 
                element faded into the background and players usually didn’t notice 
                when the rage was fully charged. I experimented with different 
                colors and sent the results to the artists to get their input and they 
                suggested a gradient between orange and yellow. I updated the color 
                of the original asset in Illustrator and also updated the particle 
                effects in the engine. This made a huge difference in visibility for 
                the rage meter.

            <p class="text">
                &emsp; The illustrator finished the map asset, and once I implemented 
                it, I realized the previous approach I had taken (plain text, no 
                background), no longer worked on the more detailed background. I 
                reworked the buttons to use the same button assets used throughout
                the rest of the game (later updated to reflect the color scheme of the 
                dialogue buttons), and added a trail of paws between areas the player 
                had already traveled between to increase readability. </p>

            <p class="text">
                &emsp; The tutorial level UI initially had the controls on 
                screen with the current objective, however, as we added control 
                schemes, it became apparent that keeping all controls on screen 
                would take far too much screen real estate or time to figure out in code.
                I was inspired by <i>Brawlhala</i>’s tutorial screen which shows a short video 
                paired with the controls to explain the game’s mechanics. I created 
                similar screens, adding all control schemes next to the mechanic. 
                The screen appears immediately as the player enters the level, and 
                though the player cannot access the screen within the level after 
                closing out of it, they are able to check the controls through the pause menu.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Working on <i>Nyaa-kuza!!</i> was a fantastic experience. I learned a great deal 
            about fighting games, brawlers, dialogue in games, and I not only 
            continued to learn about Unity, but had the opportunity to help teach my 
            teammates about it. I especially learned about what it takes to publish a 
            game and how to effectively lead a team.
            <br>
            <strong>Future opportunities: </strong>If I am ever able to revisit this project, 
            I would like to add remappable controls and make the UI dynamically 
            reflect the changes. I would also adjust some UI animations for 
            accessibility (for instance, remove flashing/flickering for those with 
            photosensitive seizures). I would also like to redesign the tutorial level 
            to allow the player to easily access the example screens I designed from 
            within the level, as well as the UI within the level to make it more 
            friendly to controllers, since this was rushed at the end of development. 
            The dialogue UI could use more help indicating which character is 
            speaking, and I would also be interested in revisiting the design entirely 
            to support scenes with more than two characters on screen. One concept I 
            had not heard of during the development cycle is that of “red fatigue”-- 
            that players can be overwhelmed by the amount of red on screen and become 
            blind to it, leading to important UI callouts fading into the noise of the 
            game. While we don’t use much pure red, we use a lot of pink, and I would 
            like to revisit our color palette to avoid pinks so when we use them they 
            are more effective.
            <br>
            <strong>Major takeaways from this project:</strong> I walked away from this game with 
            a handful of extremely valuable lessons. I will summarize below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Conflict resolution. My experience from my capstone showed me that
                     things had generally gone well for me in past group projects. 
                     When my team realized there was interpersonal conflict, I 
                     reached out to someone who has experience in facilitating 
                     to help me manage the tension on the team. The rest of the team 
                     supported me and told me how much they appreciated my efforts. I 
                     want to learn more conflict management skills and 
                     strategies to de-escalate stressful situations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What it means to lead effectively. I’ve been elected producer 
                    before, and now I feel I truly have an understanding of what that 
                    means. I have immense respect for anyone in a leadership role, and 
                    I would like to develop more skills in this area to help support my team.
                </li>
                <li>The value of teamwork and how to achieve it. When I was elected 
                    to the producer position, I did what came naturally to me and 
                    pulled everyone together to make decisions and almost 
                    instantly the previous issues of siloing and feeling a lack of 
                    ownership were resolved. Collaboration and trusting our teammates’ 
                    expertise became an integral part of our momentum.
                </li>
                <li>The point isn’t to make a game, it’s to make a team (and a game).
                    You can’t make a game if you don’t have an effective team; if you 
                    invest in your team, they will deliver because they are invested as 
                    well. I spoke with others in capstone who were amazed at my team’s 
                    momentum and willingness to work and the only thing I can explain 
                    it with is that we respected each other and we didn’t want to let
                    each other down, and it’s work we wanted to do-- for each other, as 
                    much as for ourselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The devil’s in the details. When the semester was coming to an end, 
                    it was all about “juice”, and that really hammered home to me that 
                    the difference between an obvious student game and a well-done 
                    indie game is really just in the details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iteration (and cutting content)! I’m baffled when I look back on 
                    how much we have iterated on our game, we would not have been able 
                    to deliver such a quality product without cutting basically 75% of 
                    what we had planned. We grew comfortable cutting content on this 
                    team, if something might not get done in time we would always bring 
                    it up as a possibility, usually that didn’t have to happen, but
                    we were prepared, and I think that will do us well moving forward.
                </li>
